# Meet App (React)

A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Context:
● Serverless : No backend maintenance, easy to scale, always available, no cost for idle time.
● PWAs : Instant loading, offline support, push notifications, “add to home screen” prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Key Features:
● Filter events by city.
● Show/hide event details.
● Specify number of events.
● Use the app when offline.
● Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
● View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city

## Technical Requirements:
- React application
- Build with TDD technique
- Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow
- AWS Lamda serverless
- Must passed Lighthouse's PWA checklist
- Works offline/online
